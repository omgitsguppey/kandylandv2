## Contract

- Admin Debug starts with one tracking summary panel before tab drilldowns.
- The summary has one lane per tracking system: identity, consent, event envelope, behavior math, feature telemetry coverage, legacy recovery, wallet funnel, runtime/debug evidence, cost/4xx, and open P1/P2 backlog.
- Each lane has a source owner, source of truth, status, severity, score impact, and drilldown target.
- Raw tables and dumps remain available behind drilldowns but do not render before the summary.
- The compact `/api/admin/debug` response includes the tracking summary by default. Full raw detail still requires explicit drilldown.
- User, creator, chat, and navigation surfaces are protected from this admin-only pass.
