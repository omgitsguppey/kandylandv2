## Remaining Gaps

- Runtime/provider media access smoke remains outside this source-only lock.
- Public beta score remains owner_review until external/runtime evidence gates are attached.

## Next Exact Steps

- Keep check:media-upload-lifecycle, check:private-media-access, check:creator-discovery-relationship-funnel, and check:search-discovery-cost green before new media or discovery work.
- Run check:media-discovery-score-lock after any media upload, private access, creator discovery, relationship, search, telemetry, or score wiring change.
- Use runtime smoke only after explicit operator approval; this lock intentionally avoids production reads and provider calls.

## Validation

- No validation failures.
