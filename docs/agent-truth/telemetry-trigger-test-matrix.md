## Contract

- Important triggers must have deterministic source-only tests from action/event producer through event envelope, feature activity, person metric hydration, debug lane, and score input.
- These tests do not read production, mutate live or legacy data, fake runtime/provider proof, or clear formal provider/runtime/admin gates.
- Future real activity can remain collecting, but deterministic source paths must not say waiting-on-activity when the bridge can be tested locally.

## Debug Lane

- Total triggers: 23
- Covered triggers: 23
- Missing trigger tests: 0
- UI-only tests: 0
- Waiting-on-activity deterministic gaps: 0
