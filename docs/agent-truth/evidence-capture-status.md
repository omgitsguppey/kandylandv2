## Missing Evidence

- manual screenshot evidence is missing.
- provider smoke evidence is missing.
- runtime smoke evidence is missing.
- admin truth sample evidence is missing.

## Next Exact Steps

1. Copy agent/evidence/manual-screenshot-qa/evidence.template.json to a dated JSON artifact and attach screenshots under agent/evidence/manual-screenshot-qa/screenshots/.
2. Copy agent/evidence/provider-smoke/evidence.template.json to a dated JSON artifact after provider smoke is run; redact provider tokens and secrets.
3. Copy agent/evidence/runtime-smoke/evidence.template.json to a dated JSON artifact after deployed runtime smoke is run.
4. Copy agent/evidence/admin-truth-sample/evidence.template.json to a dated JSON artifact after a fresh redacted admin truth sample is attached.
5. Run EVIDENCE_STRICT=1 npm run check:manual-screenshot-evidence once manual screenshot evidence is expected to be complete.
6. Run EVIDENCE_STRICT=1 npm run check:provider-smoke-evidence once provider smoke evidence is expected to be complete.
7. Run EVIDENCE_STRICT=1 npm run check:runtime-smoke-evidence once runtime smoke evidence is expected to be complete.
8. Run EVIDENCE_STRICT=1 npm run check:admin-truth-sample-evidence once admin truth evidence is expected to be complete.
