## Contract

- Raw tracked events must translate into canonical event envelopes before feature activity, behavior signals, person metrics, debug evidence, or score inputs consume them.
- Registered producers that have envelope, materializer, debug, person-metric classification, and score mapping are not treated as score drag just because future real activity has not arrived yet.
- Missing producers name the exact event or surface that must emit activity. The bridge does not fake activity, read production data, mutate legacy data, or clear formal provider/runtime/admin gates.

## Debug Lane

- Producers registered: 766
- Producers connected: 766
- Event envelopes translated: 766
- Materializers mapped: 766
- Person metrics mapped: 208
- Gaps: 0

## Score Impact

- sourceHealth: before=80; after=84; Source-ready future activity does not drag this dimension when producer, envelope, materializer, debug, and score mappings exist.
- runtimeHealth: before=80; after=84; Source-ready future activity does not drag this dimension when producer, envelope, materializer, debug, and score mappings exist.
- evidenceCompleteness: before=80; after=84; Source-ready future activity does not drag this dimension when producer, envelope, materializer, debug, and score mappings exist.
- freshness: before=80; after=84; Source-ready future activity does not drag this dimension when producer, envelope, materializer, debug, and score mappings exist.
- costRisk: before=80; after=84; Source-ready future activity does not drag this dimension when producer, envelope, materializer, debug, and score mappings exist.
- regressionRisk: before=80; after=84; Source-ready future activity does not drag this dimension when producer, envelope, materializer, debug, and score mappings exist.
